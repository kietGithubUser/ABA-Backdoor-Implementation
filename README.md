# Backdoor approach for assumption-based argumentation

This python code implements the backdoor approach for assumption-based argumentation frameworks (also called ABAFs). 

Before you do anything, be sure to have the "clingo" package and "python-sat" package installed, which are used in the implementation.

You can just simply open the "main.py" and run it. Just modifiy the different parameters to test the backdoor approach. The "main.py" is also filled with many detailed comments.

The instances are taken from the ICCMA2023 competition. The generator (which we used) can be found on https://iccma2023.github.io/benchmarks.html

This code belongs to the paper "Preferred Reasoning in ABA by Cycle-Breaking" by Kiet Nguyen Anh and Markus Ulbricht.
